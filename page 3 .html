				E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet. These business transactions occur either as business-to-business <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/B2B"> (B2B)</a>, business-to-consumer <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/B2C"> (B2C)</a>, consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business.
					
				</p>	
				The terms e-commerce and e-business are often used interchangeably. The term e-tail is also sometimes used in reference to the <font color="#f3971b"><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/transaction"></font> transactional processes </a>that make up online retail shopping.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					In the last two decades, widespread use of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay has contributed to substantial growth in online retail. In 2011, e-commerce accounted for 5% of total retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By 2020, with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it had risen to over 16% of retail sales.

		E-commerce is powered by the internet. Customers access an online store to browse through and place orders for products or services via their own devices.
		As the order is placed, the customer's web browser will communicate back and forth with the server hosting the e-commerce website. Data pertaining to the order will be relayed to a central computer known as the order manager. It will then be forwarded to databases that manage inventory levels; a merchant system that manages payment information, using applications such as PayPal; and a bank computer. Finally, it will circle back to the order manager. This is to make sure that store inventory and customer funds are sufficient for the order to be processed.

	</p>
	<p>
		After the order is validated, the order manager will notify the store's web server. It will display a message notifying the customer that their order has been successfully processed. The order manager will then send order data to the warehouse or fulfillment department, letting it know the product or service can be dispatched to the customer. At this point tangible or digital products may be shipped to a customer, or access to a service may be granted.

	</p>
	<p>
		Platforms that host e-commerce transactions include online marketplaces that sellers sign up for, such as Amazon; software as a service (SaaS) tools that allow customers to "rent" online store infrastructures; or open source tools that companies manage using their in-house developers.

An e-commerce platform is a tool that is used to manage an e-commerce business. E-commerce platform options range in size from ones for small businesses to large enterprises. These e-commerce platforms include online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, that simply require signing up for user accounts and little to no IT implementation.

Another e-commerce platform model is SaaS, where store owners subscribe to a service where they essentially rent space in a cloud-hosted service. This approach does not require in-house development or on-premises infrastructure. Other e-commerce platforms include open source platforms that require a hosting environment -- cloud or on premises -- or complete manual implementation and maintenance.
